					Are baby teeth important?
				</button>
				<div class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					Baby or primary teeth allow children to speak clearly and
					chew naturally. They also help guide the eruption of the
					permanent teeth, so its very important to keep good care of
					these teeth.
				</div>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					Can injuries to a baby tooth affect the developing adult
					tooth underneath?
				</button>
				<p class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					Injuries to a baby tooth can vary, those of minor concern,
					to severe injuries involving avulsion or severe displacement
					of the tooth. The more severe the injury, the more likely it
					can cause damage to the developing adult tooth.The younger
					the patient the greater the risk of injury to the permanent
					tooth. Any damage to the adult tooth is only visible after
					it erupts.
				</p>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					Children with Special Needs
				</button>
				<div class="collapsible__content">
					<p class="section__info05--textbox paragraph">
						Here at Canberra Paediatric Dentistry, we aim to create
						a warm, therapeutic environment for your child. We
						provide comprehensive care to children with special
						needs, including:
					</p>
					<ul class="section__info--points paragraph">
						<li class="section__info--point">
							Medical conditions such as Autism, Down Syndrom,
							Cerebral Palsy and ADHD

					</ul>
				</div>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					How to get your child to brush
				</button>
				<div class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					The best way is to have them start their own daily brushing
					routine once they wake up and before they go to bed. We
					recommend that you: <br /><br />
					<ul>
						<li>
							Let your children watch that you are brushing and
							flossing regularly.
						</li>
						<li>
							Let your children choose their own toothbrush &
							toothpaste flavour.
						</li>
						<li>Read them story books about tooth brushing.</li>
						<li>
							Praise your children as positive reinforcement is
							very important. We recommend saying to your child:
							“Your teeth are so clean and sparkly, keep up the
							good work and keep on brushing.”
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					How often should my child see a paeditric dentist?
				</button>
				<p class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					We generally recommend that children have check-up visits
					every six months. Going for a dental visit once every 6
					months means that your Paediatric Dentist can keep track of
					his or her dental development and treat any problems early.
				</p>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					What age do you provide services for?
				</button>
				<p class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					We see all children up to the age of 18.
				</p>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					What happens at a dental check-up?
				</button>
				<p class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					We first check the teeth and gums of your child to see if
					there’s any plaque, tartar or hidden gum disease. Depending
					on your child’s oral health and dental history, an x-ray may
					be required to detect bigger issues, such as decay,
					fractures, teeth grinding, teeth alignment and abnormalities
					below the visible gum line. Following this, we will provide
					potential treatment options and plans to achieve the best
					outcome for your child.
				</p>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					What are the symptoms of an abscessed tooth?
				</button>
				<p class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					An abscessed tooth can have symptoms such as throbbing pain,
					pain in eating, sensitivity to hot and cold, a bad taste
					or/and smell in the mouth. The gum adjacent to the tooth can
					be swollen and there is often a gum boil adjacent to the
					tooth. Sleep disturbance is often diagnostic of a dental
					abscess. Other symptoms include fever, swollen cheeks or
					jaw.
				</p>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					What is Early Childhood Caries (ECC)?
				</button>
				<p class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					Early Childhood Caries, a.k.a. “nursing bottle caries/bottle
					rot/baby bottle tooth decay”. This condition is as a result
					of continuous feeding during sleep, from the breast, bottled
					milk formula, juice or other sugary drinks. <br /><br />
					During sleep, the prolonged soaking of teeth in the sugary
					liquid increases acid attacks on the teeth enamels,
					weakening the enamels and causing cavities. <br /><br />
					If your child must have a bottle at naptime or bedtime, it
					is recommended that it contains 100% water.
				</p>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					What do ‘chalky’ teeth look like?
				</button>
				<p class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					“Chalky” teeth appear as creamy yellow-brown or opaque white
					areas on tooth enamel. They can be small areas or affect the
					whole tooth surface. Back teeth are more commonly affected
					than front teeth.
					<br /><br />
					“Chalky” teeth are hypomineralized, and are usually weaker
					and have a higher risk of tooth decay. Hypomin permanent
					teeth pose a restorative challenge and often involve
					multidisciplinary treatment planning.
				</p>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					When should I start cleaning my baby’s teeth?
				</button>
				<p class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					Start cleaning your baby’s teeth as soon as the first tooth
					erupts. <br /><br />

					Get your baby used to having their mouth cleaned early on by
					wiping the gums with a gauze or wet washcloth. This can lead
					to better cooperation when a toothbrush is introduced.
					<br /><br />

					Use a small, soft toothbrush with plain water twice a day,
					in the morning and before bed at night. A small smear of
					fluoridated toothpaste can be introduced at 18 months. You
					should also start gently flossing if the teeth have tight
					contacts. <br /><br />

					Check the young child’s teeth after they have a go at
					brushing themselves to make sure it's cleaned well. Adults
					need to supervise a child’s tooth brushing until at least 8
					years of age.
				</p>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible heading-3">
					When should I bring my child in for their first visit to the
					dentist?
				</button>
				<p class="collapsible__content paragraph">
					As soon as teeth erupt, they are at risk of decay. It is
					important to understand the caries contributing factors and
					various ways to protect the teeth from early on.
					<br /><br />
					It is advised that the child’s first visit can be when they
					turn one or when their first tooth erupts. This early
					exposure can set the good standard for the years to come.
